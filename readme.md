#Real Life Color (RYB) Mixer.

Emulate color mixing as if you where mixing real life colors, ie substractive colors

Usage:

    rybColorMixer.mix(arrayOfColors [,options]);
    
    // or
    
    rybColorMixer.mix(color1, color2, color3.... [,options]);
    
Where arrayOfColos is an array of hex RYB colors ['#ff0000', '#00ff00']. Example:

    rybColorMixer.mix(['#ff0000', '#00ff00']);

You can pass an options object:

    {
        hex: Boolean, // default is true
        result: "ryb|rgb", // default is "ryb"
    }

So, for example, if you want to return a mixed color as RGB:

    rybColorMixer.mix('#ff0000', '#00ff00', { result: "rgb" });

You can also snap to the nearest color in an array of hex colors:

    rybColorMixer.findNearest(orgColorinHex, listOfColors);

Example:

    rybColorMixer.findNearest('#fff000', ['#ff0000', '#ff0f00']);

## List of all methods:

- rybColorMixer.mix(*array* *[,options]*); **Returns a RGB color in hex.**
- rybColorMixer.mix(*color1, color2, color3, ...* *[,options]*); **Returns a RGB color in hex.**
- rybColorMixer.findNearest(*color*, *array*); **Returns a RGB color in hex.**
- rybColorMixer.rybToRgb(*color*); **convert a color from RYB to RGB.**

## Dependecies
The source coude contains the code from https://github.com/bahamas10/node-rgb2ryb
I included the rgb2ryb code inside the ryb-color-mixer for ease of use in the browser. Great job @bahamas10.
